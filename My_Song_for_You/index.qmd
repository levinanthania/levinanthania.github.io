# UTS-2 My Songs for You

Verse 1
We came with wounds unhealed,
carrying nights that never slept.
Through quiet eyes and trembling hands,
we found the strength to gently weep.

The world feels cold sometimes,
and mercy wears a fragile face.
Yet even through our brokenness,
we still can offer grace.

Pre-Chorus
Maybe love was never clean,
never bound to what’s serene.
Maybe kindness softly shines,
in hands that shake but still entwine.

Chorus
Still, we can be kind,
even when the light feels small.
Still, we can be true,
though we may stumble and fall.
For love is not perfection found,
but peace in hearts that stay around.
We’re not always whole,
but we can still be kind.

Verse 2
We walk through echoes of regret,
with voices whispering our name.
And still we offer gentle words,
like light that flickers through the rain.

Perhaps the pure are just the brave,
who choose to love through pain.
Who see the world in shades of grey,
yet still believe in grace again.

Pre-Chorus
If all that’s left are tears to give,
let them fall, let them forgive.
For cleansing never needs to shine,
it only needs to feel divine.

Chorus
Still, we can be kind,
even when our hearts feel worn.
Still, we can be true,
though our edges are torn.
For love was never meant to bind,
but to free the tender mind.
We’re not always whole,
but we can still be kind.

Bridge
Let the tears fall freely down,
they’re proof we’re still alive.
Let the silence hold our sound,
like dawn that dares to rise.
In every crack, the light will grow,
and in our flaws, compassion shows.
Still, we can be kind.

Final Chorus
Still, we can be kind,
even when the world forgets.
Still, we can be true,
when forgiveness feels like debt.
For love remains, though torn by time,
a gentle echo, pure and fine.
We’re not always whole,
but we can still be kind.

Outro
Still, we can be kind.
Still, we can be kind.
