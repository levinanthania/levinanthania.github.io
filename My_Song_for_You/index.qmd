# UTS-2 My Songs for You

**Mapping Myself**


I wake up with questions louder than my alarm

wondering if I am doing enough

or if I am just drifting through another day


My coffee tastes the same but my thoughts change

from calm to chaos to quiet curiosity

about who I am becoming in between deadlines and detours


I see people who seem to move faster

chasing dreams that already have shapes and names

while I am still trying to sketch mine on a fogged-up window


Maybe this is what growth feels like

a mix of trying and tripping

a playlist of small wins and silent breakdowns

learning to stay kind to myself even when I feel behind


I write notes that make sense only to me

I join new things even when I feel unsure

I talk to strangers who somehow sound like mirrors

I keep walking because standing still feels heavier


Some days I get it

some days I don’t

but every day I try

and maybe that’s what counts


Because one day I will look back

and realize all these confusing pieces

were quietly building the version of me

that I was searching for all along
